<!-- About -->
## About :
Pine2D is primarily a project where I can focus on implementing complex features that make up a game engine in a way that pushes me forward in learning the C# language & game development while having a practical goal.

The plan is to create a simple but robust engine I can use during game jams where iteration and production speed are critical.
 
Throughout the project, I'll try and showcase each major feature by making smaller tools/games using them.

<!-- Roadmap -->
## Main features to come :
- [X] Feature 1
- [ ] Feature 2
- [ ] Feature 3
